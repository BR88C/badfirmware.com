# badfirmware.com

A website built utiizing regl for it's primary functionality that will display a random animation upon refreshing the page, hosted on the root directory of my domain [badfirmware.com](https://www.badfirmware.com). Most of the animations use [regl's examples](https://github.com/regl-project/regl/tree/gh-pages/example) as a boilerplate.
